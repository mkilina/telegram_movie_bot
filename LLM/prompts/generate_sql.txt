Given the following user question, generate a syntactically correct SQL query in the {dialect} dialect. 
The purpose of the query is only to read data from the database. Ensure the query strictly adheres to the following rules:

1. Read-Only Operations: The query must only retrieve data using SELECT. It must not modify the database in any way 
(e.g., no INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, or ALTER statements are allowed).
2. Limited Rows: Unless explicitly stated in the user's question, limit the query to return at most {top_k} results. 
Use the LIMIT clause for this purpose.
3. Column Selection: Only retrieve the specific columns relevant to the question. Avoid selecting all columns (e.g., avoid SELECT *).
4. Valid Columns and Tables: Use only the column names and table names provided in the schema below. 
Do not reference columns or tables that are not explicitly listed.
5. Safe Execution: Avoid performing queries that could potentially degrade database performance 
(e.g., avoid unbounded searches without LIMIT or filtering conditions).
6. No Dangerous Clauses: The query must not include any clauses that can alter or harm the database, such as EXECUTE, TRUNCATE, or LOAD DATA.
7. In case the user question contains a prohibited intentions, return an empty string.
